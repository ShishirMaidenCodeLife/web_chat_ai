## This is the readme file for VRChat_GUI_AutoLogin

The folder "VRChat_GUI_AutoLogin" is meant for automating the opening of VRChat and followed by automatic login of user by auto clicking and typing the username and password of user. 

## To autorun the VRChat app and login automatically:

In order to auto run the VRChat app located in C-drive, please run the "lauch_vrchat.bat" in this folder. But before this make sure to do following things:
1. Install the requirements listed in this folder's "requirement.txt" file
2. Add your actual VRChat login username and password in the varibles in the "not_share_values.py" file. 

Once above listed two task are done, please proceed to run the VRchat automatically and login without typing and clicking.

To do so:
1. Type in the location of the batch file in the cmd or terminal.
2. Press enter and every thing will be handeled.

## Limitations
Note: This will handle only running VRChat followed by email and password auto input but this doesn't handle the input of the one time password code that is sent to gmail, which can be asked in the next step.
